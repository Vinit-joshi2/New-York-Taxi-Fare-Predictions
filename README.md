# New York City Taxi Fare Prediction

**Problem Statement:**

The New York City Taxi Fare Prediction challenge is a regression problem where the goal is to predict the fare amount (in USD) that a passenger will have to pay for a taxi ride in New York City, based on certain information available at the start of the ride.

 Historical dataset that includes:

- Pickup date and time

- Pickup location (latitude and longitude)

- Drop-off location (latitude and longitude)

- Passenger count


The task is to use this information to accurately predict the taxi fare for each trip.


**Key Features Typically Available in the Dataset:**

- pickup_datetime: When the taxi ride started (timestamp).

- pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude: The pickup location's GPS coordinates.

- dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude: The drop-off location's GPS coordinates.

- passenger_count: Number of passengers.

- fare_amount: The target variable (how much the trip cost).

We'll train a machine learning model to predict the fare for a taxi ride in New York city given information like pickup date & time, pickup location, drop location and no. of passengers.
