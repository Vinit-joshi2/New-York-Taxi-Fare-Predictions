# New York City Taxi Fare Prediction

<h1> ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:</h1>
<b>
The New York City Taxi Fare Prediction challenge is a regression problem where the goal is to predict the fare amount (in USD) that a passenger will have to pay for a taxi ride in New York City, based on certain information available at the start of the ride.
</b>

<h2>
 ðŸ“‚ Dataset that includes:
</h2>

- Pickup date and time

- Pickup location (latitude and longitude)

- Drop-off location (latitude and longitude)

- Passenger count


The task is to use this information to accurately predict the taxi fare for each trip.

<h2>
 Key Features Typically Available in the Dataset:
</h2>

- pickup_datetime: When the taxi ride started (timestamp).

- pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude: The pickup location's GPS coordinates.

- dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude: The drop-off location's GPS coordinates.

- passenger_count: Number of passengers.

- fare_amount: The target variable (how much the trip cost).

We'll train a machine learning model to predict the fare for a taxi ride in New York city given information like pickup date & time, pickup location, drop location and no. of passengers.

<h2>
 Challenges in the Problem:
</h2>

 
- Outliers: Extremely high or negative fare amounts.

- Noise: Incorrect GPS coordinates (e.g., latitudes > 90 or longitudes > 180).

- Feature Engineering: Need to derive meaningful features, such as:

    - Distance traveled (haversine distance).

    - Time-based features (day of week, hour of day).

    - Traffic patterns, holidays, weather (if available).


<h2>
 Typical Steps in a Solution:
</h2>

- Download the Dataset

   - Install required libraries
   - Download data from Kaggle
   - View dataset files
   - Load training set with Pandas
   - Load test set with Pandas




- Loading Training Set

    Loading the entire dataset into Pandas is going to be slow, so we can use the following optimizations:

     - Ignore the `key` column
     - Parse pickup datetime while loading data
     - Specify data types for other columns
     - `float32` for geo coordinates
     - `float32` for fare amount
     - `uint8` for passenger count
     - Work with a 1% sample of the data (~500k rows)

- ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

 - Prepare Dataset for Training

   - Split Training & Validation Set
   - Fill/Remove Missing Values
   - Extract Inputs & Outputs
     - Training
     - Validation
     - Test


- Data Cleaning: Remove or correct invalid coordinates, negative fares, unrealistic passenger counts, etc.

- Feature Engineering:

   - Add distance between pickup & drop

   - Extract parts of date (weekday, hour, ywar , month , days).



- Train & Evaluate Different Models

    We'll train each of the following & submit predictions to Kaggle:

    - Ridge Regression
    - Random Forests
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Decision Tree

- Evaluation: Metric usually used is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- Tune Hyperparmeters

    We'll train parameters for the XGBoost model. Hereâ€™s a strategy for tuning hyperparameters:

   - Tune the most important/impactful hyperparameter first e.g. n_estimators , max_depth m learning_rate

   - With the best value of the first hyperparameter, tune the next most impactful hyperparameter
